This repository contains the Modified Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), implemented using Tkinter, including a Persian version. Developed by Farzad Soleimani and Parinaz Khosravani, this task is widely used in psychology and neuroscience to study decision-making under uncertainty and risk.

## Overview

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a psychological experiment designed to simulate real-life decision-making. Participants select cards from four different decks to maximize their winnings. Each deck follows a different reward and penalty pattern, representing advantageous and disadvantageous strategies.

Our modified version introduces new features and flexibility while ensuring cultural relevance for Persian-speaking participants. The original task design is based on the work of Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson (1994):

Bechara A., Damasio A. R., Damasio H., Anderson S. W. (1994). Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition, 50, 7-15.

## Features

Modified Version

Built using Tkinter, making it lightweight and easy to use without external dependencies.

Includes updated rules and mechanics to enhance adaptability for various experimental designs.

Adds an option for participants to pass or play specific decks, introducing more nuanced decision-making dynamics.

Highlights one deck with a black arrow, introducing a cognitive bias element to the task.

Adjusts reward and penalty structures for a more controlled examination of decision-making strategies.

## Persian Version

Fully localized into Persian, making it accessible for Persian-speaking participants.

Accommodates cultural and linguistic differences while maintaining fidelity to the original task's objectives.

## Flexibility

Easily configurable for different research purposes and participant groups.

Supports adaptations for both clinical and experimental research.

## User-Friendly Interface

Simple and intuitive interface for both participants and experiment administrators.

Provides clear instructions in both English and Persian.
